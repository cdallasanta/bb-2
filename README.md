# Backyard Birding
This is a web adaptation of the [Backyard Birding](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/backyardbirdinggame/backyard-birding?ref=nav_search&result=project&term=backyard%20birding) board game by Jeremy Schwartz and Jeff Morgenroth. This adaptation is a single-player experience where you are attempting to build your "backyard" full of things that birds would love, and attempt to catch sightings of the birds, scoring more points for those in season. At the end, your game score is saved to the server, and the top 10 scores are listed.

## How to play
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vJUEIh6yHc) video from the kickstarter page is an excellent place to learn the rules. In short:
1. Draw 2 bird cards to add to the Flock. These are available to entice into your backyard.
2. Draw then play 2 backyard cards from your hand to your backyard. These determine what birds you can roll for, and how successful you will be.
3. Pick a bird, and roll a dice. The more of their habitat needs you have in your backyard, the more successful you will be.
4. Roll the dice to see which birds fly away.

Once the bird deck and flock are both empty, the game is over!
